## Live Example

The example app is a very tiny example of this library being used to query anime character data from anime list.

## Live Example source code

Best way to see how this is used is looking at the Example App source code:
[Found here](./example/src)

## Install

Npm:
```bash
npm install --save @doughtnerd/wrangler-di
```

Yarn:
```bash
npm add @doughtnerd/wrangler-di
```

## Usage


### Injecting
First, you need to use the `withInjector` function to provide the services that you will inject in child components down the component tree.

#### App.jsx
```jsx
import React from 'react'

import { withInjector } from '@doughtnerd/wrangler-di'

import { HTTP_SERVICE, AxiosHTTP } from './services/axiosHttp'

import { AUTH_SERVICE, AuthService } from './services/authService'

const appProviders = [
  { provide: HTTP_SERVICE, useClass: AxiosHttp },
  { provide: AUTH_SERVICE, useFactory: (httpService) => new AuthService(httpService), deps: [HTTP_SERVICE] }
]

const App = () => {
  return (
    // The rest of your app
  )
}

export default withInjector(<App />, appProviders)
```



### Accessing Injected Providers
You must use the `withProviders` function to wrap the component you wish to inject. 

```jsx
import React from 'react'

import { withProviders } from '@doughtnerd/wrangler-di'

import { AUTH_SERIVCE } from './services/authService'

/*
 * The component you use will have a `deps` array prop added. 
 * Each element in the array is the injected provider you define when you use `withProviders`
 */
const SignInPage = ({deps: [authService]}) => {

  return (
    <form onSubmit={(e) => {
        e.preventDefault()
        authService.login(e.target.username.value, e.target.password.value)
      }
    }>
      <input name="username" type="text"></input>
      <input name="password" type="password"></input>

      <button type="submit">Sign In</button>
    </form>
  )
}

// `AUTH_SERVICE` is the `Injection Token` of the thing you're trying to inject.
export default withProviders(SignInPage, [ AUTH_SERVICE ])
```

## API

### Injection Token
An injection token is a string that the injector uses to uniquely identify providers. 
This string can be anything you like but __MUST__ be unique within a single injector.

A Provider object's ```provide``` key is an Injection Token.

It is recommended that this string get set to some constant in order to reduce mistyping or 'magic string' issues.

```js
{ 
  provide: 'HttpService', // <- This is an injection token
  useClass: MyHttpService 
}
```

### Provider
A provider is something that the injector will use to create the services that are consumed within an app.

There are three different types of providers.

#### Value Provider
> Used to provide value objects or functions.
```js
{ provide: 'FooBarProvider', useValue: { foo: 'bar' } }
```

#### Constructor Provider
> Used to provide a class that the injector will create for you
```js
{ provide: 'HttpService', useClass: MyHttpService }
```

#### Factory Provider
> Used to provide a factory function that will control how the provider is created.
> Can be used with ```deps```, which is an array of injection tokens of other providers.
```js
{ provide: 'AuthService', useFactory: (httpService) => new AuthService(httpService), deps: ['HttpService'] }
```
If deps are used, the function assigned to ```useFactory``` will be called with deps in the same order as they are in the ```deps``` array.
```js
{ 
  provide: 'AuthService', 
  useFactory: (httpService, graphqlService) => { // Notice httpService and graphqlService are in the same order as 'deps'
    return new ApiService(httpService, graphqlService)
  }, 
  deps: ['HttpService', 'GraphqlService'] 
}
```

### withInjector
This function takes two parameters: The component you want to wrap with an injector and the array of providers you want to make available for injection.
```jsx
const appProviders = [
  { provide: HTTP_SERVICE, useClass: AxiosHttp },
  { provide: AUTH_SERVICE, useFactory: (httpService) => new AuthService(httpService), deps: [HTTP_SERVICE] }
]

// This is also correct
withInjector(<App />, appProviders)

// So is this
withInjector(<App initialAppConfig={ {foo: "bar"} } />, appProviders)

// This is NOT correct
withInjector(App, appProviders)

```

You don't have to provide everything in one injector. If you have a service that only needs to be injected for one page, provide it at that page level. This library is smart enough to resolve hierarchical dependencies. 

Example:
```jsx
// App.jsx
import MyFavoritesPage from './MyFavoritesPage'

const appProviders = [
  { provide: HTTP_SERVICE, useClass: AxiosHttp }
]

const App = () => {
  return (
    <MyFavoritesPage />
  )
}
export default withInjector(<App />, appProviders)
// ------------ END OF FILE ----------------------

// MyFavoritesPage.jsx
import { FavoritesApi } from './favoritesApi'

const pageProviders = [ 
  { provide: 'FavoritesApi', useFactory: (httpService) => new FavoritesApi(httpService), deps: [HTTP_SERVICE] } 
]

const MyFavoritesPage = ({deps: [favoritesApi]}) => {
  return (
    <ul>
      {favoritesApi.getFavorites().map(favorite => <li key={favorite}>{favorite}</li>)}
    </ul>
  )
}

const MyFavoritesPageWithDeps = withProviders(MyFavoritesPage, [ 'FavoritesApi' ])

export default withInjector(<MyFavoritesPageWithDeps />, pageProviders)
// ------------ END OF FILE ----------------------
```

### withProviders
This function takes two parameters: The component you wish to inject with dependencies, and an array of Injection Tokens. It returns a HOC that can then be passed any props that are on the original component minus the `deps` array.
```jsx
/**
 * If props for the SignInPageBase component are:
 * { deps: [AuthService] }
 * 
 * This is all you need to do to inject (assuming you've used `withInjector` somewhere above in the component tree)
 */
const SignInPage = withProviders(SignInPageBase, [ 'AuthService' ])

// No props need to be provided, the HOC has taken care of the `deps` array
return <SignInPage />

/**
 * If you have more props than the `deps` array, for example:
 * { allowGoogleSignIn: boolean, deps: [AuthService] }
 * 
 * You are still able to set the other props like you would with a normal component
 */
const SignInPage = withProviders(SignInPageBase, [ 'AuthService' ])

// You can set the prop without having to set the `deps` prop. The HOC still handles setting that and passes any other props to the `SignInPageBase` component
return <SignInPage allowGoogleSignIn={false} />
```

## FAQ
### Why are there no hooks or contexts that I can use?
First, Context is useful in many scenarios but is both over-used and used inappropriately. Often using Context makes the component that uses it harder build, test, and re-use.

Second, because Context and hooks defeat the purpose of using dependency injection in the first place - especially 

## Warnings - Possible errors if you don't follow
- Don't update the array used in withProviders at runtime
- Don't update the array used in withInjector at runtime
- Don't mutate Value Providers
- Don't use `deps` with Constructor Providers
